#NESulator

NESulator is an NES emulator based off javidx9's video series on the topic. However, I have taken efforts to work independently and to diverge from many specifics of his implementation. This is a passion project, and though I have great ambitions, we'll see just how complete it gets.

The current state of completion is as follows, ordered by priority:
Disassembler: TBD
Assembler: TBD
6502 CPU: scaffolding is in place, little implementation.
